Subject: resolved: simplify alloc size calculation

The allocation size was calculated in a complicated way, and for values
close to the page size we would actually allocate less than requested.

Reported by Chris Coulson <chris.coulson@canonical.com>.

CVE-2017-9445

(cherry picked from commit db848813bae4d28c524b3b6a7dad135e426659ce)
